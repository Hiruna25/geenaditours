                        <h4>Munishwaram Temple :-</h4>
                        Munneswaram temple is an important regional Hindu temple complex in Sri Lanka. It has been in 
existence at least since 1000 CE, although myths surrounding the temple associate it with the popular 
Indian epic Ramayana, and its legendary hero-king Rama. The temple is one of the ancient Pancha 
Ishwarams dedicated to Shiva in the region. 
According to the legend, the temple is situated at a place where king Rama of Ajodhya prayed to Siva 
after his war with the demon-king Ravana of Lanka. Munishwaram means the first temple for Shiva 
(Munnu + Easwaran). History Say the Shiva Lingam located in the temple was already here when Lord Rama visited this place.
<h4>Manavari Temple</h4>
<p>Manavari Temple is about 5km from Munishwaram Temple, near the banks of the Deduru Oya. 
Manavari is the Place Lord Rama installed first lingam to the Viamana and prayed. 
Lord Rama after his victorious battle left for Ajodhya with Seeta in one of King Ravana's Vimanas. He felt 
he was being followed by a Bramhaasthi Dosham. He stopped the Vimana at this juncture and asked god 
Lord Shiva for advice. Lord Shiva blessed Lord Rama and advised installing and praying at four lingams 
located at Manavari, Thiru Koneshwaram, Thiru Ketheshwaram and Rameshwaram in India to get rid of 
the dosham. Since from this lingam is called as Ramalinga Shivan. 
                   <h4>After visiting the temples travel to Sigiriya</h4>

                    <h4>Thiru Koneswaram Temple </h4>
                    Koneswaram temple also known as Dakshinakailasha is a classical-medieval Hindu temple dedicated to 
Lord Shiva in Trincomalee, Eastern Sri Lanka. Konesvaram is revered as one the Pancha Ishwarams, of Sri 
Lanka for long time. The construction time of Koneswaram has been estimated by comparison between 
carved reliefs on the temple's ruins, literature on the shrine and the inscriptions commonly used in royal 
charters from the 5th to 18th centuries. Koneswaram was likely founded before 400 B.C. although its 
exact date of birth remains vague. 
                    <h4>Sri Muthumariamman Temple</h4>
                    The current temple was built in 1874. The temple was originally a small statue under a tree prayed to by the Hindu 
people but has been developed by the people in Matale. One of the most visually dominant features of this temple 
is its 55 m (180 ft) high Gopuram ('Raja Koburum'), a large decorated tower located above the main northern 
gateway ('Vadakku Veli Veedi') to the temple. The Raja Koburum is one of the largest Gopurams in Sri Lanka. The 
1008 statues of Hindu deities are the work of South Indian sculptor, Nagalingam and his son Ramanathan, with the 
help of about 100 designers, painters and architects from Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka

                    <h4>Tea Plantations</h4>
                    <p>Tea was first planted in Sri Lanka in 1824 at the Botanical Gardens at Peradeniya, when a few plants were brought from China. More were introduced from Assam in 1839. In 1867, a Scottish Planter named James Taylor planted tea seedlings in 8 hectares of forestland, in the Loolkondura Estate. In 1873, the tea export industry of Sri Lanka began with a modest 23 lbs. being shipped to London.</p>
                    <p>Tea will grow only on rolling terrain and is classified by elevation into low grown, medium grown and high grown into 3 main groups. Today more than 200,000 hectares in highlands and other areas are under Tea and around 300 million Kilograms, with a 25% of world tea exports are done by Sri Lanka as the World's largest Tea exporter.</p>

                    <p>The 'Little England' of Sri Lanka, is set against beautiful backdrops of Mountains, Valleys, Waterfalls and Tea Plantations. It is supposed to be one of the coolest places in the Island, but it is really just like an English spring day, although the temperature does drop at night.</p>
                    <p>All around Nuwara Eliya you will see evidence of the British influence, houses like country cottages or Queen Ann style mansions. The Victoria Park, in the middle of the town, is a lovely place for a stroll or a picnic and is also good for Birding as you get some rare birds in this Park.</p>
                    <p>Seasons may be absent elsewhere in Sri Lanka, but here you can read them by the flowers, which bloom in the spring (March to May) and the fall (August and September). These are the "seasons" when low-country folk flock to Nuwara Eliya to escape the sea level heat and humidity.</p>

which was formed from Sita's tears. The temple itself is one of the more enterprising establishments devoted to this 
legend, and contains a granite statue of Lord Hanuman that is said to be over 40 feet tall.It is believed that Lord 
Hanuman was searching for Sitadevi from these hills of Ramboda. The Ramboda area is believed to be an area

depressions said to be the footprints of Lord Hanuman.
